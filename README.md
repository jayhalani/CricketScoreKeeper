# CricketScoreKeeper
This is the second project I've submitted to Udacity for the Android Basics Nanodegree. The main criteria of the Project is to create an 
Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.
This app has ability to keep track cricket score on time. This is very basic and very handy App to keep track cricket scores.
